## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with the DCMs for Depression project, here are the next few steps. 

## Where to find what:

- The Classification_and_Regression_DCM (https://gitlab.ethz.ch/tn_projects_fs2025/Project_8/-/tree/main/Classification_and_Regression_DCM) contains all the scripts to analyse generative embeddings with classification and regression models.
- The from_DATA_to_DCM folder contains all the scripts and a README to generate GLMS, VOI/ROIs and DCMs from the Ketamine Mechanism of Action Study
