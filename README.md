# Project 8

## The project was carried out as a part of ETH Zurich's Spring Semester 2025 course Translational Neuromodeling (227-0973-00L) taught by Prof. Dr. Klaas Enno Stephan

## Goal 
The project implements Probabilistic Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) on time series fMRI to predict Ketamine treatment response in depression patients using Machine Learning Models

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with the DCMs for Depression project, here are the next few steps. 

## Where to find what:

- The Classification_and_Regression_DCM (https://github.com/keyshavmor/Probabilistic-DCM-Modeling-for-Predicting-Ketamine-Treatment-Response/tree/main/Classification_and_Regression_DCM) contains all the scripts to analyse generative embeddings with classification and regression models.

- The from_DATA_to_DCM (https://github.com/keyshavmor/Probabilistic-DCM-Modeling-for-Predicting-Ketamine-Treatment-Response/tree/main/from_DATA_to_DCM) folder contains all the scripts and a README to generate GLMS, VOI/ROIs and DCMs from the Ketamine Mechanism of Action Study
dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005917/versions/1.0.1/download)

- The For_Permutation_Testing directory has all the resources for permutation testing the different machine learning models.
