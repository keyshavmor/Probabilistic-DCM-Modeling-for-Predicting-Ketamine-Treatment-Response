# Classification and Regression on Generative Embeddings

## Getting started

- The scripts and data in this folder are self-contained and apart from Julia no other language or tool are needed. Please ensure that you have installed Julia, Jupyter Notebook for Julia and all the relevant packages mentioned in the notebooks.

- The Project.toml and Manifest.toml files are present in this repository.

- The notebooks use relative paths to acess the DCM files for the 4x4, 11x11, 15x15 DCM parameter files.

- The DCM folders already contain the DCM files for ses-b0 for the 26 depressed subjects.

- These notebooks and DCM files should be sufficient to obtain identical results to our findings in the project report.

- The figures, tables and "Regression Performance" directories already contain all the important results from our experiments.
